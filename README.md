## Environment variables for LLM integration

The default values are
```
AI_MODEL       meta-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
AI_HOST        http://127.0.0.1:1234
AI_ENDPOINT    /v1/chat/completions
AI_APIKEY
```

Simply set the env variables to your needs, by following the format above (e.g. url starting with "http", no ending slash, AI_ENDPOINT with leading slash and path)

Some examples:

```bash
AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini AI_HOST=https://api.openai.com AI_APIKEY=sk-proj-123 npm start

# or with docker in background
docker run -e AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini -e AI_HOST=https://api.openai.com -e AI_APIKEY=sk-proj-123 -d -p 3000:3000 christianfei/my-yt:latest
# running in foreground
docker run -e AI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini -e AI_HOST=https://api.openai.com -e AI_APIKEY=sk-proj-123 --rm -it -p 3000:3000 christianfei/my-yt:latest
```

## Why?

- wanted to get back my chronological feed, instead of a "algorithmically curated" one
- no distractions
- no clickbait thumbnails (using `mq2` instead of `mqdefault` thumbnail, thanks @drcheap)
- no comments
- no related videos, or any algorithmically determined videos pushed in your face
- no sponsors, thanks to SponsorBlock
- just videos and a clean UI
- wanted to dabble with [Server-sent Events](https://github.com/christian-fei/my-yt/blob/main/lib/sse.js)
- wanted to try integrate the so much hyped AI in a personal project
- wanted to try out `yt-dlp`
- wanted to experiment with the HTML5 [`<track>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/track) element and [WebVTT API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebVTT_API)
- feedback was awesome on [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43373242), so here we are
- I am even paying for YouTube Premium, so it's not a matter of money, but a matter of control over my attention and enhanced offline experience
